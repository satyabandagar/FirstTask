            <h3>Kabaddi</h3>
            <p>Kabaddi is a traditional Indian outdoor sport that originated in ancient India. It is a team game played
                between two teams of seven players each. The main objective is for a raider to enter the opponent’s
                half, tag as many defenders as possible, and return safely to their own half while continuously chanting
                “kabaddi.” The game requires strength, speed, breath control, and quick decision-making. Kabaddi is
                widely played across India and has gained international recognition through the Pro Kabaddi League.</p>
